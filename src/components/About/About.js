        America has a problem with waste. Over <b>40% of all food</b> produced
        in the US is thrown away every year, while <b>85% of our clothing</b>{' '}
        and textiles end up in a landfill. These numbers are alarming on their
        own, but even worse when matched with conditions of real and dire need.
        Today, <b>1 in 6 children</b> live below the poverty line in the US, and
        struggle to meet their basic needs day by day.

        both Pennsylvania based nonprofits first met in 2021. The two PA based
        nonprofits found connection in their goal of recovering and distributing
        surplus goods to fight poverty in their communities. Fueled by Sharing
        Excess's background in using technology to bring community volunteers
        together, and For Good's deep roots with local public schools, and idea
        was formed.

        After years of running the country's first free store in Braddock, PA,
        For Good's founders built a deep relationship with the teachers, social
        workers, and administrators of the local public school system. As one of
        few truly no-questions-asked mutual aid organizations, Gisele and
        Kristin became the go-to resource for immediate needs like clothing,
        bedding, and school supplies.
